# tvshowapp

This app was built to showcase my Vue.Js capabilities. It was built using the following frameworks/libraries:

- Vue 3
- Axios (for API call)
- Vue-Horizontal (for horizontal lists)
- Jest (for unit-testing)
- Lint 

The following requirements were met:

- Build app that uses open TV shows API http://www.tvmaze.com/api to show list of shows
- List should be horizontal
- By clicking on a show a new window should open with more information (made use of a modal, using a separate reusable componenent)
- User is able to filter the shows on Genre
- Shows are sorted by rating from high to low
